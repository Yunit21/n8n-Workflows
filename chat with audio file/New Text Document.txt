⚙️ Built an AI workflow that turns audio files into a searchable knowledge base

I recently built an end-to-end automation in n8n that does something really powerful with audio content 👇

🎧 Upload an audio file
→ 📝 Automatically transcribed & summarized using AI
→ 🧠 Stored as embeddings for future Q&A
→ 💬 Chat with the audio like a document

How the workflow works:

1️⃣ User uploads an audio file via a form
2️⃣ Audio is sent to AssemblyAI for:

Speech-to-text

Speaker labels

Bullet-point summaries
3️⃣ The transcript is:

Chunked

Embedded using Google Gemini

Stored in Pinecone (vector database)
4️⃣ File activity is logged in Google Sheets
5️⃣ A chatbot retrieves relevant context from Pinecone and answers questions based on the uploaded audio

📌 Result:
You can ask questions about meetings, podcasts, calls, or interviews — and get accurate answers directly from the audio content.

Tech stack:

n8n (automation)

AssemblyAI (STT + summarization)

Google Gemini (embeddings + chat)

Pinecone (vector search)

Google Sheets (logging)

This kind of workflow is perfect for:
🎯 Meeting intelligence
🎯 Podcast knowledge bases
🎯 Call analysis
🎯 Internal documentation from voice data

Automation + AI makes unstructured data actually usable.
